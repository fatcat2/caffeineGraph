# Ryan's Caffeine Graph

This is really just a way for me to practice with D3.js. I recently started using it and it seems pretty fun and intuitive! I'm using a Google Sheet as my data source, and using tabletop.js to convert the Google Sheet into a dictionary.

The dataset I'm using is super rough, as I'm measuring by cup of caffeine-drink (e.g. one boba/PMT/bubble tea, one coffee, one cup of tea, etc.). Thus, this data must not be used as anything except a measure of how much work I needed to get done that day.
